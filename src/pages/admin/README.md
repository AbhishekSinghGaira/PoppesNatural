# Product Management System

## Overview
This directory contains the admin interface for managing products in the PoppeNatural application. The system allows administrators to add, edit, and delete products from the inventory.

## Changes to Image Storage Approach

### Previous Implementation
Previously, the product management system used Firebase Storage to handle product images:
- Users would upload image files directly through the admin interface
- Images were stored in Firebase Storage
- Download URLs were generated and stored in Firestore along with product data

### New Implementation
The image storage approach has been modified to use external image URLs instead of Firebase Storage:
- Users now provide direct URLs to product images hosted elsewhere
- No file upload functionality is implemented
- Image URLs are validated before saving product data to Firestore

### Benefits of New Approach
1. **Reduced Dependency**: No longer requires Firebase Storage configuration
2. **Simplified Infrastructure**: Images can be hosted on any image hosting service
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminates Firebase Storage usage costs
4. **Flexibility**: Allows use of images from various sources (stock photo sites, CDN, etc.)

### URL Validation
The system validates image URLs to ensure they:
1. Are properly formatted URLs (http/https protocol)
2. Have valid image file extensions (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp)
3. Load successfully in the preview pane

### Implementation Details
- File: `AddEditProduct.tsx`
- Removed imports: `ref, uploadBytes, getDownloadURL` from `firebase/storage`
- Removed state variable: `imageFile`
- Removed functions: `handleImageChange`, `uploadImage`
- Added state variable: `imageUrl`
- Added functions: `handleUrlChange`, `isValidUrl`, `isImageUrl`
- Modified form to include URL input instead of file upload
- Modified submit handler to validate URLs instead of uploading files
- Updated URL handling to show preview immediately while typing
- Improved error handling for image loading failures
- Enhanced user experience when editing existing products

### Usage Instructions
1. When adding or editing a product, provide a direct URL to the product image
2. Ensure the URL points to an actual image file with a valid extension
3. The image preview will display the image from the provided URL
4. If the image fails to load, an error message will be shown
